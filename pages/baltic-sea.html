          <h2 class="first__heading">Sopot</h2>
          <p class="first__content">
            Sopot is Poland’s biggest and perhaps most extravagant beach resort
            with a population of approximately 40,000. It’s sandwiched between
            two other cities – Gdańsk and Gdynia – which together form Tri-City
            (Trójmiasto in Polish). Renowned for its wooden pier ( the longest
            in Europe)which provides amazing views over sandy beaches and the
            Baltic Sea, it features trendy bars, restaurants, clubs and high-end
            hotels frequented by affluent Poles, mixed with typical seaside
            attractions such as waffle shops and souvenir stands. Other
            highlights include the surrealist Crooked House on Sopot’s main
            street Monciak, which was inspired by the drawings of Polish book
            illustrator Jan Marcin Szancer and the annual Open’er music
            festival, which takes place every July in the nearby Gdynia-Kosakowo
            airport.

          <h2 class="second__heading">Łeba and Ustka</h2>
          <p class="second__content">
            Łeba and Ustka are coastal towns situated on the two opposite sides
            of the beautiful Słowiński National Park – famous for its “shifting
            dunes”, which move due to strong winds creating a desert like
            landscape. The park was added to the UNESCO list of World Biosphere
            Reserves in 1977. Łeba features a mix of high-end establishments
            like the iconic Neptun Hotel, more low-key options including rooms
            for rent and smaller hotels, while Ustka boasts two beaches (one
            high-cliffed, one flat) connected by a pedestrianised bridge on the
            Słupia River, which divides the town in two. It is also home to many
            cafes and fish restaurants, and an annual firework festival (every
            July).

          <h2 class="third__heading">Kołobrzeg</h2>
          <p class="third__content">
            The city of Kołobrzeg is known for its historic architecture (such
            as the 17th century lighthouse and the gothic St. Mary’s Basilica)
            and spa resorts, which are popular mainly among Polish and German
            tourists. Life centres around its port, concrete pier and a
            promenade filled with ice cream shops, beer gardens and souvenir
            stands. If you’re staying here for a couple of days, make sure you
            take the ferry to Bornholm Island, which belongs to Denmark and is a
            great cycling spot. To get away from the crowds, take a long walk on
            the beach, or head to nearby Grzybowo village.
