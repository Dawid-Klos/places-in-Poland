          <p class="first__content">
            Sopot is Poland’s biggest and perhaps most extravagant beach resort
            with a population of approximately 40,000. It’s sandwiched between
            two other cities – Gdańsk and Gdynia – which together form Tri-City
            (Trójmiasto in Polish). Renowned for its wooden pier ( the longest
            in Europe)which provides amazing views over sandy beaches and the
            Baltic Sea, it features trendy bars, restaurants, clubs and high-end
            hotels frequented by affluent Poles, mixed with typical seaside
            attractions such as waffle shops and souvenir stands. Other
            highlights include the surrealist Crooked House on Sopot’s main
            street Monciak, which was inspired by the drawings of Polish book
            illustrator Jan Marcin Szancer and the annual Open’er music
            festival, which takes place every July in the nearby Gdynia-Kosakowo
            airport.
