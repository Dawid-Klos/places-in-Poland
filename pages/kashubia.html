          <p class="first__content">
            If there's a more beautiful region in Poland, we are yet to lose to
            that argument! Described as Poland's little Switzerland by a number
            of writers, Kashubia (PL: Kaszuby / KS: Kaszëbë) is the picturesque
            rural area spanning a 100km west of the Tri-city. Blessed with
            forests, lakes and rustic, pre-industrial architecture, Kashubia is
            the home of Kashubian people, a Slavic ethnic group whose language
            is often described as a mix of Polish and Low German - a legacy of
            the dynamic history of Northern Poland. Notable individuals that
            share this unique heritage include author Günter Grass and former EU
            President Donald Tusk. From the forests and lakes of Kartuzy to the
            farmlands of Szymbark and all the way out to the vast sand dunes
            around Łeba and further along the gorgeously beach-lined Hel
            Peninsula, you will rarely find such a diverse geographical region
            anywhere else in Central Europe. The Kashubians themselves have
            mythologised that God created the world in 6 days and, with all the
            leftover bits-and-pieces in his bag of cosmic creativeness, he
            created Kashubia!

          <h2 class="second__heading">A world gone mad in Szymbark</h2>
          <p class="second__content">
            For most Poles, Szymbark is synonymous with midrange supermarket
            fruit juice. Aside from fresh produce, Szymbark has a number of
            interesting cultural landmarks, most notably (yet) another open-air
            museum with traditional Kashubian housing and a Wizard-of-Oz-style
            house flipped on its head! In addition, the world's longest plank,
            at 46.53m in length, can be viewn here. Behind the open-air museum
            is the still-functioning Church of St. Wojciech, a beautiful wooden
            structure, built in 1782, featuring a large belfry stands in front
            of the entrance a late-baroque Rococo interior.<br /><br />
            <b class="second__smaller-heading">HAVE A BATH IN BEER!</b><br /><br />
            Just across the field from the upside-down house, you will find the
            Kaszëbskô Kóruna brewery, an extention of Hotel Szymbark with a
            number of local beers on tap that can be more than just a quick
            drink. In a big wooden tub, you can relax with aeration in a
            natural, aromatic composition of hops, yeast and beer malt with
            herbs. It may sound awful for some, but it great for the skin and
            you can have a water-based rinse afterwards. All the while, the wall
            tap is available for you to enjoy Kashubian Crown beer to your
            heart's content! If you're still not sold on the whole beer-bath
            thing, you can just simply dine in 'civilised' fashion downstairs
            and accompanied with a huge plate of Kashubian cuisine.

          <h2 class="third__heading">The endless beaches on Hel Peninsula</h2>
          <p class="third__content">
            Without a doubt the most unique shape on the Polish coastline, the
            Hel peninsula has seen many ships come and go over the centuries and
            the ancestors of the Kashubians, Poles and Prussians who stood on
            this headland would have no doubt heeded the impending change with
            each one. You'll find beaches at the localities of Jastarnia, Jurata
            and the dog-friendly Kużnica, just to name a few. Parking along the
            peninsula can be a bit of a pain so consider getting the train from
            Gdynia Główna to Władysławowo and then switch to the local service.
            This is also a great bike route: a pleasant single road with lots of
            beach on either side of you. It's a 35km route, very flat and will
            take you 1hr 40 minutes if you go directly. At the tip of the
            peninsula, the town of Hel itself is a pleasant fishing port with a
            Fokarium (Seal Sanctuary) and lots of Kashubian cultural landmarks.
