          <p class="first__content">
            Probably the most famous between tourists are a mountain range that
            form a natural border between Slovakia and Poland. They are the
            highest mountain range in Poland. The Tatra Mountains occupy an area
            of 785 square kilometres (303 sq mi). The highest point in Poland,
            Rysy, at 2,499 m (8200 ft) is located south of Zakopane. The Tatras
            are protected by law by the establishment of the Tatra National
            Park, Slovakia and the Tatra National Park, Poland, which are
            jointly entered in UNESCO’s World Network of Biosphere Reserves.
            There are around 650 caves in the park, of which the Wielka Sniezna
            cave system is the longest (18 kilometres (11 mi)), and the deepest
            (maximum depth 814 metres (2,671 ft)). Six caves of this system are
            open to public. The park has over 30 mountain lakes, called staw
            (Polish: pond). These water bodies are an important part of the High
            Tatra landscape. The largest lakes are: Morskie Oko with an area of
            349,000 m² and maximum depth of 50.8 metres (167 ft)); and Wielki
            Staw with an area of 344,000 m² and maximum depth of 79.3 metres
            (260 ft).

          <h2 class="second__heading">The Bieszczady Mountains</h2>
          <p class="second__content">
            Bieszczady is a mountain range that runs from the extreme south-east
            of Poland through Ukraine and Slovakia. Frequently Bieszczady refers
            only to the Western Bieszczady or even only to the part of the range
            lying within Poland. Most of the Polish range is covered by a
            Bieszczady National Park. Currently Park occupies an area of 292.02
            square kilometres (112.75 sq mi), covering the highest areas of the
            Polish part of the Bieszczady Mountains. In 1992 the Park and its
            surrounding areas became part of the UNESCO East Carpathian
            Biosphere Reserve. Forest cover about 80% of the area of the
            National Park. The woods are mainly natural and in some cases it can
            be said that they have preserved their pristine character. The
            highest peak in the park, Tarnica, is 1,346 metres (4,416 ft) above
            sea level. Animal life is abundant with several species of
            endangered animals thriving in the area, among them bears, wolves,
            wildcats, wild boars, beavers, otters and lynxes as well as deer,
            moose and European bisons (of which around 100 live in the area).
            The Park also contains interesting bird species, including eagles
            and owls, and is home to the largest Polish population of
            Aesculapian snakes.

          <h2 class="third__heading">The Karkonosze National Park</h2>
          <p class="third__content">
            The National Park in the Karkonosze – Mountains in southwestern
            Poland, along the border with the Czech Republic. The park is
            located in Lower Silesian Voivodeship, in the highest part of the
            Sudetes. It was created in 1959 to cover an area of 55.10 km². Today
            it is slightly larger at 55.76 km2 (21.53 sq mi), of which 17.18 km²
            is strictly protected. The majority of the park area, around 33.80
            km², consists of forests. In 1992 Karkonosze National Park, together
            with the neighbouring Czech National Park, became part of the
            Krkonose / Karkonosze biosphere reserve under UNESCO’s Man and the
            Biosphere (MaB) programme. Its highest peak is Śnieżka at 1,602
            metres (5,256 ft) above sea level, forming a triangle with
            (similarly sounding) Śnieżnik, 1,424 metres (4,672 ft), as well as
            Ślęża peak, further apart. They are connected by a red hiking trail
            only for qualified tourists.Śnieżka is unique in its rounded,
            treeless cap, which stands in sharp contrast to other, lower peaks.
            There are about 100 various birds living in the park, the most
            numerous of animal species living there. In the higher parts of the
            mountains there are fewer species of them; in the lower levels there
            are 100 varieties, but in the peaks there are not more than 10. The
            park has four species of fish, six species of amphibians, and five
            species of reptiles. The park’s attraction are mouflons, brought
            here at the beginning of the 20th century.
